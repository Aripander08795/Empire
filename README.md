# Empire
Empire Incremental

An idler game about building an empire through city building and colonization.

## Roadmap
Alpha Goals

1. Build UI
Game starts as a clicker then evolves into an idler; the UI in general needs a lot of development

2. Basic resouce management
Most resources are gained from mines, some like lumber are not however.
The basic resources can be manually harvested by the player, but also automated through the citizen system.
Advanced resources must be obtained through proper management of your empire.

3. Citizen management system
Citizens are a special type of resource.
Constructing housing will allow the player to gain new citizens.
New citizens are gained automatically after the player constructs housing, but they don't materialize immediately.
Farming will effect how fast empty housing is filled.

4. Farming system
The farm will allow the player to assign idle citizens to work as farmers.
The number of farmers will affect how fast you gain new citizes.
Some unique buildings such as the green house will upgrade farm effectiveness.

5. Mine prospecting
Mines are the primary source of mineral resources, to gain new mines the player must undertake a prospecting action.
Prospecting will reveal a location where a mine can be constructed and show an estimate for what kind of resources 
that mine would produce, the player can then deside to constuct a mine or not.

6. Mines
Once a mine has been built the player can assign idle citizens to work in that mine as miners.
The miners will extract whatever mineral types are contained in that mine until it depletes, once fully depleted the
mine is closed permanently and new mines must be found through prospecting.

7. Factories
Factories are another way to utilize citizens, factories consume resources to produce something else.
More workers asigned to a factory means a faster rate of production.

The lumber mill will technically be a factory but not consume any resources, it's just the method for
automated lumber harvesting. The first planned real factory is the steel mill which will consume iron
and coal to produce steel.

8. Tech trees
Some starter ideas for tech upgrades have been implimented but they need polish and cost balancing to keep
the early game running at a decent pace.

9. Game options menu
This will contain options to do things like import and export a save file and reset the game

## Beyond Alpha - Beta Roadmap
1. Exploration
The first step in colonization is discovering places to colonize, this will be like an advanced version of the prospecting
system to discover new places and perhaps unique encounters.

2. Outposts
The player will advance beyond the starting city and construct outposts which will gain access to
mineral deposits that contain better consentrations of rare materials. These outposts will have some kind of
extra challenge involved in maintaining them, not currently a fully fleshed out idea.

3. Biomes
New locations will have different biomes which govern what kinds of challenges and resources are encountered there.

4. Trade
Making contact with neutral settlements could allow for trade.

5. Conquest
Why trade when you can just take it? Train soilders and equip them with weapons to take what you need.

6. Space
Eventually the player will advance into the space age and build colonies on other planets, these colonies will 
be difficult to develop but yield rare materials.

7. Base building
Not sold on this idea, might allow the player to design their city layout instead of just building quantities of things
but could over complicate the basic game.

8. Random events
Stuff to add flair to the game and reduce predictability.

9. Offline mode
When you reload progress should be advanced as if you had left the game window up and running unattended.
